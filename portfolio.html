        <h1>what i likes </h1>
        <p>As a person, I have a lot of likes and dislikes. I believe that our likes and dislikes are what make us unique and different from others. They help us understand ourselves better and give us a sense of identity. In this essay, I will be discussing some of the things that I like.

            One of the things that I like is reading books. I have always been an avid reader since I was a child. Reading books has helped me gain knowledge and broaden my perspective on various topics. It has also helped me improve my vocabulary and writing skills. Whenever I read a book, I feel like I am transported to a different world, and it helps me escape from reality for a while.
            
            Another thing that I like is traveling. I love exploring new places and experiencing different cultures. Traveling has helped me become more open-minded and accepting of people from different backgrounds. It has also helped me appreciate the beauty of nature and the world we live in. Whenever I travel, I feel like I am on an adventure, and it helps me create memories that I will cherish forever.
            
            Lastly, I like spending time with my family and friends. They are the people who have been there for me through thick and thin. Spending time with them helps me relax and forget about my worries. It also helps me create new memories and strengthen my relationships with them.</p>

It’s a great way to keep my mind sharp and focused.

            Another thing that I like is spending time with my friends. As an undergraduate student, I have made a lot of new friends, and I enjoy spending time with them. We like to hang out, watch movies, and play games together. It’s a great way to relieve stress and have fun.
            
            Lastly, I like learning new things. As an undergraduate student, I am constantly learning new things in my classes. I enjoy learning about different subjects and expanding my knowledge. It’s a great feeling to learn something new and be able to apply it in real life.</p>

        <h1>my belives and customs</h1>
        <p>Sure, here’s a passage on the topic of “Beliefs and Customs” that an undergraduate student might write:

            As an undergraduate student, I have come to appreciate the importance of beliefs and customs in shaping our lives. Beliefs are the convictions that we hold to be true, while customs are the practices and behaviors that are common in a particular society. Together, they form the foundation of our identity and help us understand the world around us.
            
            As a Sri Lankan, I am proud of my beliefs and customs. One of the most important beliefs in Sri Lankan culture is the concept of “Samma Ditthi,” which means right view. This belief emphasizes the importance of having a clear understanding of the world and our place in it. It encourages us to be mindful of our actions and to strive for a better future.
            
            Another important belief in Sri Lankan culture is the concept of “Metta,” which means loving-kindness. This belief emphasizes the importance of treating others with compassion and respect. It encourages us to be kind to others and to help those in need.
            
            When it comes to customs, Sri Lanka has a rich and diverse culture. One of the most important customs is the celebration of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year. This is a time when families come together to celebrate the start of a new year. It is a time for renewal and reflection.
            
            Another important custom in Sri Lanka is the practice of Ayurveda. This is a traditional system of medicine that has been practiced in Sri Lanka for thousands of years. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy mind and body through natural remedies and practices.</p>
